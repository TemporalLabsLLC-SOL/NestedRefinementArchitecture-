Exclusion Model
Purpose:
The Exclusion Model will systematically filter out irrelevant, low-priority, or non-qualifying data, ensuring that Temporal Labs focuses resources on the most promising leads and projects.

Structure and Parameters:
Industry-Based Exclusions

Purpose: Exclude industries that are not aligned with Temporal Labs' strategic focus.
Criteria: Industries that do not fit Temporal Labs' service offerings or market focus.
Parameters:
Industry Codes (NAICS/SIC): Specific industry codes to exclude.
Industry Names: Descriptions of industries to exclude.
Sector Exclusions: Broader sectors to avoid (e.g., agriculture, mining).
Geography-Based Exclusions

Purpose: Exclude regions that are not within Temporal Labs' operational focus or where legal, logistical, or market conditions are unfavorable.
Criteria: Non-targeted geographic locations.
Parameters:
Countries: List of countries to exclude.
Regions/States: Specific regions or states within a country to exclude.
Cities: Cities that do not align with operational goals.
Budget-Based Exclusions

Purpose: Exclude potential clients that do not meet the minimum budgetary requirements for Temporal Labs’ services.
Criteria: Insufficient budget for services.
Parameters:
Minimum Budget Threshold: The lowest acceptable budget for engagement.
Currency Considerations: Ensure budgets are converted and compared accurately.
Interest-Based Exclusions

Purpose: Exclude leads that demonstrate low interest or engagement with Temporal Labs’ offerings.
Criteria: Low engagement or interest levels.
Parameters:
Engagement Metrics: Email open rates, click-through rates, response rates.
Interest Levels: Categorized as High, Medium, Low based on interactions.
Company Size Exclusions

Purpose: Exclude companies that are too small or too large for Temporal Labs' typical client profile.
Criteria: Non-qualifying company sizes.
Parameters:
Employee Count: Minimum and maximum number of employees.
Annual Revenue: Minimum and maximum revenue thresholds.
Previous Interaction Exclusions

Purpose: Exclude leads or clients with negative previous interactions or history.
Criteria: Poor interaction history.
Parameters:
Previous Engagements: Record of past engagements.
Interaction Quality: Ratings or feedback from past interactions.
Resolution Status: Whether past issues were resolved satisfactorily.
Project Type Exclusions

Purpose: Exclude project types that do not align with Temporal Labs’ capabilities or strategic focus.
Criteria: Non-aligned project types.
Parameters:
Project Categories: Types of projects to avoid (e.g., projects requiring hardware development if Temporal Labs focuses on software).
Technical Requirements: Exclude projects requiring technologies not supported by Temporal Labs.
Implementation Steps:
Data Collection

Collect relevant data for each exclusion parameter from CRM systems, market research, and internal records.
Automated Filtering

Use AI and machine learning algorithms to automate the exclusion process based on defined parameters.
Regular Updates

Continuously update exclusion parameters based on new data, market trends, and strategic shifts.
Validation

Test the exclusion model on historical data to ensure accuracy and relevance.
Validate the model periodically to refine and improve its effectiveness.
Integration

Integrate the exclusion model into CRM and lead management systems to automate the filtering process.
Example of Exclusion Model in Action:
Scenario:
Temporal Labs receives a lead from a small startup in the agricultural sector located in a remote region with a limited budget. The lead engagement metrics show low interest, and the company has a history of unresolved issues with previous service providers.

Application of Exclusion Model:
Industry-Based Exclusions: Agricultural sector is excluded.
Geography-Based Exclusions: Remote region excluded.
Budget-Based Exclusions: Budget below the minimum threshold.
Interest-Based Exclusions: Low engagement metrics.
Company Size Exclusions: Too small based on employee count and revenue.
Previous Interaction Exclusions: Unresolved issues in past interactions.
Project Type Exclusions: Not aligned with Temporal Labs’ focus on AI and software solutions.
Result:
The lead is automatically filtered out, saving resources and ensuring Temporal Labs focuses on more promising opportunities.
