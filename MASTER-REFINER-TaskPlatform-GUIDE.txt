Task Duration: Estimated time to complete each task.
Task Prioritization

Purpose: Methods for prioritizing tasks to ensure high-impact activities are addressed first.
Parameters:
Prioritization Criteria: Criteria for determining task priority (e.g., urgency, impact).
Priority Levels: Defined levels of priority (e.g., high, medium, low).
Scheduling: Guidelines for scheduling tasks based on priority.
Task Delegation

Purpose: Guidelines for delegating tasks to ensure efficient workload distribution.
Parameters:
Delegation Criteria: Criteria for delegating tasks (e.g., skill set, workload).
Delegation Process: Steps for delegating tasks effectively.
Monitoring Delegated Tasks: Methods for tracking and monitoring delegated tasks.
Task Monitoring and Reporting

Purpose: Monitor the progress of tasks and report on their status.
Parameters:
Progress Tracking: Methods for tracking task progress (e.g., project management software).
Status Reporting: Frequency and format of status reports.
Key Performance Indicators (KPIs): Metrics for measuring task performance.
